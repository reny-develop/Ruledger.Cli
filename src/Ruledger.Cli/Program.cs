// Derives a test design from a Rulealize rule set, and applies one to the next version of it.
//
//   ruledger derive  <rule set>                 walk it, and write the test design down
//   ruledger diff    <test design> <rule set>   apply one to a version of the rules
//   ruledger observe <rule set>                 what a position is compared on
//
// Nothing here fetches. The vocabularies a rule set draws on come from a folder, which is
// what `rulealize restore <rule set>` fills, and the rule sets a composite holds come from
// the folder that composite sits in or from the one restore fetched into. Two tools writing
// one folder is a folder neither can account for, so this one only reads.
//
// The three settings a walk has are the three flags below it, and they are the whole of what
// is not derived from the rule set. Each is named after what it counts — states, candidates,
// outcomes — because a reader of a test design cannot look up what else a name would mean. They
// travel in the test design, which is why `diff` does not take them — it walks the new
// version the way the test design in front of it was walked, and refuses a flag that would
// make the two incomparable.

// A rule set names its inputs and its states in whatever language it was written in, and
// what comes back out is those names: a card is '10♠', a day is '月'. The console's own code
// page turns both into question marks, which would make the one thing a person matches
// against their rule set unmatchable.
